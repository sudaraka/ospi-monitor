OpenSprinkler Pi Monitor v0.1 (Alpha)
=====================================

Following instruction is for downloading the source and installing the alpha
release os OSPi Monitor for testing.

## 1. Download ##

Source code is available on the git repository:

http://git.sudaraka.org/opensprinkler/ospi-monitor/

	git clone http://git.sudaraka.org/opensprinkler/ospi-monitor

or, download and extract the source archive:

http://git.sudaraka.org/opensprinkler/ospi-monitor/snapshot/ospi-monitor-0.1-alpha.tar.gz

## 2. Installation ##

At this alpha testing stage OSPi Monitor will run from the extracted source
directory. Simply extract the files from tarball if you are not using the git
clone.

Note: Assume the full path to directory you extracted from the source tarball
or git clone is OSPIM_DIR

## 3. Configuration ##

Copy the ospim.conf-dist to /etc/ospim.conf (or you may rename it in place)

	cp OSPIM_DIR/ospim.conf-dist /etc/ospim.conf

Copy the web interface files to /var/www/ospim directory.

	cp -r OSPIM_DIR/html /var/www/ospim

Create the zone data storage file. [TODO: This step will be built into the code
in final release]

	mkdir /var/lib/ospim
	touch /var/lib/ospim/zone.json

## 4. Running ##

OSPi Monitor daemon can be started right from the source directory. It must run
as root.

	OSPIM_DIR/ospimd.py start

Daemon script supports start, stop and restart command line parameters.
