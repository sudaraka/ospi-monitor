would like to get the demo programs provided by opensprinkler.org combined and
updated to work nicely with a mobile web interface.  It will be re-released GPL
to the community.

Here are the key requirements:

* combine manual and calendar python code bases into one service that runs at
  boot.  init.d files etc should be included as part of a debian package.

* have web interface that is mobile compatible to turn on and off the sprinkler
  zones.  Same functionality as the ospi_manual.py script today, but make it
  work on a mobile screen without zooming in and out, and make the buttons show
  up with customizable names from a config file.
  For instance Zone 1 = "Front Yard" etc.

* keep the functionality from ospi_gc.py

* keep track of sprinkler zone state across the two functions.  If the calendar
  turns on a zone it should show up as active on the web interface.

* roll it all up in a deb package with dependencies so novice users (well
  novice users that are OK with command line package installation, not novice
  users who can't change batteries in their mouse...but I digress....) can
  install and take advantage of sweet system.

* code should be light weight as it is running on a Pi.  The python http socket
  implementation is fine, but I would like to stay away from Apache etc.
