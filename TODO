would like to get the demo programs provided by opensprinkler.org combined and
updated to work nicely with a mobile web interface.  It will be re-released GPL
to the community.

Here are the key requirements:

* combine manual and calendar python code bases into one service that runs at
  boot.  init.d files etc should be included as part of a debian package.

* roll it all up in a deb package with dependencies so novice users (well
  novice users that are OK with command line package installation, not novice
  users who can't change batteries in their mouse...but I digress....) can
  install and take advantage of sweet system.
